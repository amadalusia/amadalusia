# What happened to Balkenix?

Balkenix was a false identity created for the purpose of misleading distasteful people from my past.

However, I am now fairly confident that the manhunt is over. As such, I will complete a full redesign of my current identity.

# Why?

I don't want to talk about it. It was just plenty of strong mistakes from beginning to end.

# Who was really Balkenix? (a re-introduction)

Hey, I am Artur. I am an alfacinha (lisboner) with a fair bit of experience in English and Norwegian, and partially spanish.

I live in Lisbon but I also visit the UK or Norway, 3 months per year.

I am self taught in the art of Nix, Python, C++, Linux, and linguistics.

# Ending thoughts

I am sorry to those I have mislead for so long, I wish it would have been easier.

Particularly sorry to those who knew me as being Scottish and Norwegian, I was lying the entire time because of fear.
